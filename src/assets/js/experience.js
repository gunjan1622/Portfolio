Generating a summary of the extracted PDF or any text given by the user wherein I used the T5 pre-trained model.</li> <li> I Used KeyBERT to find all the keywords in the text and it outputs a relevancy table of the keywords.</li> <li> I then used sense2vec, a model by explosion.ai which finds the same sense words when the user inputs a keyword from the relevancy table. These words generated by sense2vec are then used for Question generation using a T5 transformer. </li>",
